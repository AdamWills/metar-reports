# Airport METAR Reports

Submission by Adam Wills

## Notes
1. In the Example Reports, the 3rd option 'FR 110232Z 001100G121MPS' contains 3 digits after the 'G', but the formatting guidelines specify 2. Standing by the guidelines and ignoring the 3rd digit, but of course, would want to verify in a real world scenario.
